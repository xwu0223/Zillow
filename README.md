# Zillow
This repo tackles the first round of Zillowâ€™s Home Value Prediction Competition, which challenges competitors to predict the log error between Zestimate and the actual sale price of houses. And the submissions are evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error between the predicted log error and the actual log error. The competition was hosted from May 2017 to October 2017 on Kaggle, and the final private leaderboard was revealed after the evaluation period ended in January 2018.  The score of the stacked model in this repo would have ranked in the top-100 and qualified for the private second round, which involves building a home valuation algorithm from ground up.
